# Arrow_Game_ITP_MiniProject
At this repository you can find my mini project for ITP course at Shahid-Beheshti-University

This repository is about arrow game which you have to control the arrow that it's not hiting the wall around it.
Also there is some assets for you that you can use them but it has some assets by defult when you launch it.
For launch this game you need to set up the SDL on your IDE.

NOTE: When you download the this project you need to change the path of assets in code with your own paths.
